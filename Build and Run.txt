Steps to Build and Run:

- You will need Visual Studio 2019 and .net core 3.1 installed to build the solutions locally.

- Application 2 is the BlazorÂ web app so build it in Visual Studio and make sure that before 
Running in Visual Studio, in the options beside the Debug/Release button:
"WebIOApp" is selected instead of "IIExpress".

- Upon running the web page should open with https://localhost:5001

- Application 1 is a normal WPF Desktop app so build it in Visual 
Studio and run it usually. Note: For a successful connection, 
the Web App must be already running before starting this App, 
otherwise connect manually using the "Connect" 
button once the Web App is running.

- Connection will fail, if the server URL does not match. There is an option to enter 
the URL manually. Just enter the actual localhost URL of the 
Web App along with the extension "/netzschhub" and press the "Connect" button.

- Multiple instances of Desktop Apps can be created keeping the above steps in mind.

-Entering any value in the input field of any of the Desktop instances will immidialtey 
update the Web App Output field and of the other running Apps. Vice-Versa is also true, 
but after pressing the "Send" Button on the Web Page
